    request for their personal data including phone number and email address details
    to be deleted before the expiry of this period by emailing
    [madriexcepcional@promotioncustomerservices.com](mailto:madriexcepcional@promotioncustomerservices.com), although the Promoter cannot

    Winner’s Prize or assist them following deletion of their contact details.
22. The Promoter must either publish or make available information that indicates that
    a valid award of the Prizes took place and therefore will publish or make available

    details for 3 months after the promotion closing date by emailing
    [madriexcepcional@promotioncustomerservices.com](mailto:madriexcepcional@promotioncustomerservices.com). Entrants can object to such
    disclosure, or request that disclosure be limited in scope by emailing

    notwithstanding any objection, disclose the information to the Advertising
    Standards Authority if required to do so.
23. **General:** The Promoter cannot be held responsible for the failure of any third party
    to fulfil its obligations in connection with this promotion, although the Promoter will
    endeavour to minimise the effect of such failure on the entrants.
24. The Promoter is not responsible for any entries which fail to be registered or are
    delayed for any technical or other reason whatsoever. The Promoter cannot be held
    responsible if the Winner does not receive their Prize as a result of having provided
    incomplete or inaccurate email address details.
25. The Promoter reserves the right to verify the winning entries including asking for a
    Winner’s identity, including proof of age, (which they must provide within 5 days but
    which will not be retained following verification by the Promoter and redemption of
    the Prize) and to refuse to award the Prize or withdraw the Prize entitlement and/or
    refuse further participation in the promotion and disqualify the participant where
    there are reasonable grounds to believe there has been a breach of these terms
    and conditions or any instructions forming part of the entry requirements or
    otherwise where a participant has gained unfair advantage in participating in the
    promotion or won using fraudulent means. The Promoter will be the final arbiter in
    any decisions, and these will be binding, and no correspondence will be entered into
    in relation to this clause.
26. In the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the Promoter, or
    otherwise where fraud, abuse, and/or an error (human or computer) affects or
    could affect the proper operation of this promotion or the awarding of the Prize, the
    Promoter reserves the right to suspend the promotion, replace the Prize with an
    alternative Prize of equal or higher value, or amend these terms and conditions, at
    any stage, with no liability to any entrants or third parties, but will always endeavour
    to minimise the effect to participants in order to avoid undue disappointment.

    in accordance with English law and the parties to any dispute or action shall submit
    to the jurisdiction of the English and Welsh courts.
